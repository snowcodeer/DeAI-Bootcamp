jollof rice
Jollof rice is a popular West African dish known for its rich flavors and vibrant color. Here's a detailed recipe to help you make delicious jollof rice from scratch.

### Ingredients

#### For the Rice:
- 2 cups of long-grain parboiled rice
- 4 cups of chicken or vegetable broth (or water)
- 1 cup of vegetable oil (or use less for a lighter dish)
- 1 medium onion, chopped
- 2 medium tomatoes, blended into a smooth puree (or use canned tomatoes, about 14 oz)
- 1 to 2 tablespoons of tomato paste (optional, for extra richness)
- 1 red bell pepper, blended with the tomatoes
- 1-2 fresh chilies (optional, adjust for spice preference)
- 2-3 cloves of garlic, minced
- 1-2 teaspoons of ginger, minced
- 1-2 teaspoons of thyme (dried or fresh)
- 1-2 teaspoons of curry powder (optional)
- 1 bay leaf
- Salt to taste
- A few whole peppercorns (optional)

#### For Protein (Optional):
- Chicken, shrimp, or any protein of your choice, seasoned and cooked (grilled or fried)

### Preparation Steps

1. **Prep the Rice:**
   - Rinse the parboiled rice in cold water until the water runs clear. This helps to remove excess starch and prevents the rice from becoming sticky.
   - Soak the rice in water for about 30 minutes if desired, then drain.

2. **Make the Jollof Base:**
   - In a large, deep pot, heat the vegetable oil over medium heat.
   - Once hot, add the chopped onions and saut√© until translucent.
   - Stir in the minced garlic and ginger, cooking for another minute until fragrant.
   - Mix in the blended tomatoes and red bell pepper. If using, add the tomato paste at this stage. Cook the mixture down on medium-high heat for about 15-20 minutes, stirring occasionally until it reduces and the oil begins to separate from the tomato base.

3. **Season the Base:**
   - Add the thyme, curry powder, bay leaf, salt, and peppers (if using). Mix well and cook for another 5 minutes to let the spices bloom.

4. **Add the Rice:**
   - Stir the rinsed rice into the pot, ensuring that it is coated with the tomato mixture. Cook for about 3-5 minutes, allowing the rice to absorb some of the flavors.

5. **Cooking the Rice:**
   - Pour in the chicken or vegetable broth. Stir gently, ensuring that the rice is evenly spread in the pot. Bring to a simmer and adjust the heat to low.
   - Cover the pot tightly with a lid (you can seal the edges with foil to trap steam if necessary) and let it cook on low heat for about 25-30 minutes. Avoid lifting the lid during cooking as this will release the steam.

6. **Check for Doneness:**
   - After about 25 minutes, check the rice for doneness. It should be cooked through but not mushy, and all the liquid should be absorbed. 
   - If there is still liquid, cover and cook for an additional 5-10 minutes.

7. **Final Fluffing:**
   - Once cooked, turn off the heat and let the rice sit for another 10 minutes. Then, remove the lid and fluff the rice with a fork.

8. **Serve:**
   - Serve your jollof rice hot, accompanied by fried plantains, grilled chicken, or other proteins of your choice. You can also garnish it with fresh herbs or slices of avocado for added freshness.

### Tips:
- **For Extra Flavor:** Letting the dish sit a few minutes before serving allows the flavors to meld.
- **For a Smoky Flavor:** Some cooks like to cover the pot with a banana leaf or parchment paper, making sure to trap steam, to get a smoky flavor.
- **Protein Variations:** You can add cooked meat or shrimp to the rice during the last few minutes of cooking to heat through.
