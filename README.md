## Meet Chef Winston "Sizzle" James 

Winston is a true maestro of the kitchen and a living legend in Trinidadian cuisine. With over 40 years of experience tucked under his apron, Chef Winston has mastered the art of blending bold flavors, rich spices, and hearty laughter into every dish he creates. His culinary journey began as a young boy at his grandmother's side, where he learned the secrets of traditional Trini cookingâ€”how to coax the perfect heat from a pepper, how to balance sweet, savory, and spice with finesse, and most importantly, how to cook with love.

He loves making Trinidadian Food served with Good Humour ðŸ˜‰
