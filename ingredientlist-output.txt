It sounds like you have the perfect ingredients for a delightful Mediterranean Ratatouille! Here’s a detailed recipe for you:

### Mediterranean Ratatouille

#### Ingredients:
- **2 medium aubergines**, diced
- **2 medium carrots**, sliced
- **2 medium potatoes**, diced
- **1 onion**, chopped
- **3-4 cloves garlic**, minced
- **2-3 celery stalks**, diced
- **3-4 ripe tomatoes**, chopped (or one can of chopped tomatoes)
- **4 tablespoons olive oil**
- **1 teaspoon dried herbs** (like thyme, oregano, or Herbes de Provence)
- **Salt and pepper**, to taste

#### Preparation Steps:

1. **Prepare the Vegetables**:
   - Wash and peel the carrots and potatoes if desired. Chop the aubergines, carrots, potatoes, celery, and onion into even-sized pieces to ensure even cooking.

2. **Sauté the Base**:
   - In a large skillet or a saucepan, heat 4 tablespoons of olive oil over medium heat.
   - Add the chopped onions and cook until they become translucent (about 5 minutes).
   - Stir in the minced garlic and sauté for another 1-2 minutes until fragrant.

3. **Cook the Vegetables**:
   - Add the diced carrots and celery to the pan, and sauté for about 5-7 minutes.
   - Next, add the aubergines and stir well to combine. Cook for another 5 minutes.
   - Incorporate the diced potatoes and allow them to cook for 5 more minutes, stirring occasionally.

4. **Add Tomatoes and Spices**:
   - Pour in the chopped tomatoes (or canned tomatoes) and mix everything together.
   - Season with salt, pepper, and your mix of dried herbs. Stir well.
   - Bring the mixture to a gentle simmer.

5. **Simmer the Ratatouille**:
   - Reduce the heat to low and cover the pan. Let it simmer for approximately 30-35 minutes, allowing all the flavors to meld together. Stir occasionally; if it looks too dry, add a splash of water or some vegetable broth.

6. **Final Adjustments**:
   - Taste and adjust the seasoning if needed, adding more salt, pepper, or herbs according to your preference.

7. **Serve**:
   - Once the vegetables are tender and the flavors are well blended, remove from heat.
   - Serve warm, garnished with fresh basil or parsley if desired. This dish pairs beautifully with crusty bread, over polenta, or as a side to grilled meats or fish.

### Tips:
- You can customize your Ratatouille by adding other vegetables such as zucchini or bell peppers.
- This dish can be made ahead of time and is often more flavorful the next day after the flavors have had more time to come together.
